# GANZoo

Collection of TF2 and Keras implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks. This projects is largely ignited by that of [Erik](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN) with two purposes:

- Update new models.
- Maintain OOP style as official tutorials: GPU-Util is higher in this way.
